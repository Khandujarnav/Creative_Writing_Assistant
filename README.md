## 📖 Project Overview

**Creative Writing Assistant for Hindi** is a story-generation tool designed to behave like a traditional **Katha Vachak** (Storyteller).  
Unlike generic AI systems that simply translate English narratives, this assistant creates original Hindi folk-style stories enriched with:

- 🌾 Indian rural settings  
- 🐾 Talking animals & folk motifs  
- 👑 Courtroom tales similar to *Panchatantra* and *Akbar-Birbal*  
- 🪔 Automatically inserted **Muhavare (Proverbs)**  
- 📜 Always ends with a meaningful **Seekh (Moral)**  

It also supports a **Bilingual Mode** that shows the **Hindi story + English translation** side-by-side.
